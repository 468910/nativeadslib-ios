## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

In order to use the library and have monetization tracking you need to get an advertiser token from Pocket Media. Contact support@pocketmedia.mobi to create an account and get a token.

## Installation

PocketMediaNativeAds is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PocketMediaNativeAds"
```

## Look and feel

The look of the ads is totally customisable, that's the root objective of the project. One of the easiest ad units to adapt would be the in-feed native ads, but you can use the data we provide you in any way, as long as you don't trick the users and don't force them to click your ads.
